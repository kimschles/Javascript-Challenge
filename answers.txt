    var a = 100 + 4 * 5;
    //What is the value of a? 180

#4
    var b = (100 + 4) * 5; 520
    //What is the value of b? Why are they different? Var be is adding 100 and 4 together,then multiplying this answer by 5.
    var a was doing the math in line, left to right.

  var x = "It's raining!";
  var y = "It's pouring!";
    //What is x - y?
    //Why? Err... nothing maybe? Two strings can't be subtracted from one another. Just a guess.
